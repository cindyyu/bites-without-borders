=====================

[completed] Final group project for CS camp. First time building a web application in Python. 

<b>What</b> A web application that allows users to upload and find recipes based on location. I took care of the application's backend and some of its frontend using the following technologies:
<ul>
  <li>
    Google AppEngine Services
    <ul>
      <li>Datastore</li>
      <li>Users API</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Jinja2</li>
  <li>Webapp2</li>
  <li>Google Maps API</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
</ul>
<b>When</b> July 2014<br />
<b>Why</b> Final group project for Google's Computer Science Summer Institute program. <br /><br />

<b>To Work On</b> (if I pick up later)
<ul>
  <li>Use Images API to store two different sized images for recipes. (2 users & exceed bandwidth quota for free plan ..)</li>
  <li>Form sanitization and other form input bugs.</li>
  <li>Tags and filtering system. (maybe select between meal categorization and health needs (gf, dairyfree, etc.)</li>
  <li>Design. (l0l)</li>
</ul>
